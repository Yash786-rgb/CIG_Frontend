WHY IS RETENTION IMPORTANT 

Affordability : It's 5-25X more expensive to
acquire a new customer
2. ROI: A 5% increase in customer retention can
increase company revenue by 25-95%. 80% of
future revenues come from 20% of existing
users.
3. Loyalty: Retained customers buy more often
and spend more than newer customers.
They've learned the value of a product or
service and keep coming back
4. Referrals: Satisfied, loyal customers are more
likely to refer â€” bringing in new customers,
free of charge.

It is something that excites me and comes to me naturally .I noticed this first when I started using Android devices (class 9) I was very peculiar about the UI of the app ,it's user flow so I used to download tons of app just to test them and select the one that gives the best  experience also I was one very fond of finding bugs/ issues and used to write loads of reviews on playstore after this I got busy in my JEE preparation
In college I worked as a Designer in my first year in my college club , I  also tried Software engineering in my second year and cracked 2 software internships. But during my internships /hackathons  I felt like the best part about them was the brainstorming and discussion part about the idea of the project.I find that I really enjoy different aspects of product dev ,to think about design to software to marketing strategy. I wasn't aware of product development as career option I first heard about it when flipkart came for placements (for my senior year) for the APM Role then I read further about it and now I feel it is the best role for me,which will help me to be a part of whole product development process and I can give my voice/opinion in different stages of the development process
